## 🎯 Dashboard Improvements Made

### 1. SBU Metric Cards - FIXED ✅
- **Problem:** Cards showed "0 POs" and "$0" for all SBUs
- **Solution:** Fixed SBU name mapping to match database full names
- **Result:** All SBU cards now display correct:
  - Total number of POs
  - Total value in USD
  - Total value in NGN (in parentheses)

### 2. Responsive Card Sizing - FIXED ✅
- **Problem:** Numbers distorted cards at different zoom levels
- **Solution:** Implemented responsive font sizing using CSS `clamp()`
- **Benefits:**
  - Cards maintain consistent size at all zoom levels (50% - 200%)
  - Text scales proportionally without breaking layout
  - Numbers don't overflow or distort card dimensions
  - Better mobile/tablet experience

### 3. Expiring PO Alert - ENHANCED ✅
- **Problem:** Alert was not clickable
- **Solution:** Added "View Details" button that navigates to Analytics page
- **Result:** One-click access to Expiry Risk Analysis section
